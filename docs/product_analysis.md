# Product Analysis Guide

### Motivation for product analysis
If you have been told what to build or you already know what exactly you want to build, you   
technically are one step ahead of here:  
You have the product definition, and from that you could start creating/developing! Happy  
developing!(although you should still document product definition at [product_definition.md](/docs/product_definition.md) ) But I beleive its not enough! Knowing the what, without understanding 
of the why,only works if everything goes according to plan, specially, the plan should go acording   
to the plan! We all know that's not happening, at least not where we live, in the the real world. 

For every important decision, we need to document not only the decision, but also why we made that specific decision.

We beilive that knowing and documenting "the what" is not enough and we should document "the why"  
and also all the fights and arguments that comes before "the what". Product analysis is about  
"the why" and all the fights and arguments and thinking that comes before "the what", or product   
definition


- should we move this part to [README](/README.md) ?

### Product Analysis
The goal of Product Analysis is to explore, analyze, and document the problem space that the product  
is aiming to address. This phase is about getting clarity on the why and the what of the product.  
The final clean version of the what of product will goes into product_definition.md  

Product analysis focuses on identifying the purpose, target audience, use cases, and initial feature  
ideas. It’s about defining the problem space and gathering insights before any actual development   
starts.


Explore the **needs and requirements** of the product from the user's perspective. 

- It helps you:

    - Understand the user’s needs and their pain points.
    - Identify the market opportunity and potential gaps in current solutions.
    - Define the product's value proposition—how it will create value for users and stand out from   
    competitors.
    - Establish initial assumptions about the product's core functionality, potential features, and   
    use cases.

- **Purpose**: Why does this product exist?
- **Target Audience**: Who are the users, and what are their needs?
- **Use Cases**: High-level descriptions of user scenarios.
    - What are the primary scenarios in which the product will be used?
    - How will users interact with the product in these scenarios?
    - Are there any edge cases or exceptional circumstances?
- **Problems to Solve**: Specific challenges the product addresses.
    - What pain points are you solving for your users?
    - What existing solutions exist, and how does your product improve on them?
- **Initial Feature Ideas**: Brainstorm potential features.
    - What features must the product have for it to fulfill its purpose?
    - Are there any non-essential but nice-to-have features?
    - How should features be prioritized, considering time and resources?

### Important Aspects
- Understand the problem space.
- Define the audience and their needs.
- Explore use cases comprehensively.
- Identify and evaluate potential features.

### a summary for product analysis 
Purpose: Explore and document the problem, use cases, features, and the rationale behind decisions.
Steps:
Write the Problem Statement: What problem are we solving?
Define the Target Audience: Who are the users? What are their needs?
Brainstorm Use Cases: List real-world scenarios.
List and analyze potential Features: Include pros, cons, and feasibility.
Record the Decision-Making Process: Justify why features are selected or rejected.

### Product Analysis Workflow


### Questions to think about
- What is the product and what does it do and what solutions it provides
    - take a step back, look at everything from above, what is the prolem that this product address?  
    - why this problem? are you focusing on right problem and solutions?
