# Product Analysis Guide

### Motivation for product analysis
If you have been told what to build or you already know what exactly you want to build, you   
technically are one step ahead of here:  
You have the product definition, and from that you could start creating/developing! Happy  
developing!(although you should still document product definition at [product_definition.md](/docs/product_definition.md) ) But I beleive its not enough! Knowing the what, without understanding 
of the why,only works if everything goes according to plan, specially, the plan should go acording   
to the plan! We all know that's not happening, at least not where we live, in the the real world. 

For every important decision, we need to document not only the decision, but also why we made that specific decision.

We beilive that knowing and documenting "the what" is not enough and we should document "the why"  
and also all the fights and arguments that comes before "the what". Product analysis is about  
"the why" and all the fights and arguments and thinking that comes before "the what", or product   
definition


- should we move this part to [README](/README.md) ?

### Product Analysis
The goal of Product Analysis is to explore, analyze, and document the problem space that the product  
is aiming to address. This phase is about getting clarity on the why and the what of the product.  
The final clean version of the what of product will goes into product_definition.md  

Product analysis focuses on identifying the purpose, target audience, use cases, and initial feature  
ideas. Itâ€™s about defining the problem space and gathering insights before any actual development   
starts.
